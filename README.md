<h3 align="center"> How I started coding </h3>
I started coding when there was lockdown in India. We were all at home and one day as I was scrolling through youtube , I saw how coding is done . My first ever coding lang was C++ and I also have a copy in which I write C++ and other Enjeeneering stuff . But now once I complete C++ I won't write courses in my copy anymore . I would write only Enjeeneering stuff there .

My Dream is to master all coding languages in the world . And I know one day it will come true . I have a youtube channel named <strong>Extreme Programming</strong>. Do please subscribe to me .

I like coding because I can create many things with that. I can create things that will help people. I like making things that people like. That's why I am learning web dev. I would try my level best always.
